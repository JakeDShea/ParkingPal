## Parking Pal

## Description
Parking Pal allows students to understand their parking pass and make informed choices on where they will park. It should also show information as to which parking lots have available space in them and help students 

## Badges
(Insert with badges here?)

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
This application may be imported to any android device as a .apk file and run within android devices. 

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
For additional assistance, please email jcruxton@email.wm.edu. 

## Roadmap
There will be four main releases for each of the four project submissions: P4, P5, P6, and P7. P7 will be the completed product with proper functionality. 

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
